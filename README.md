idk how to do this and couldnt figure out how to change the urls and not overwrite code git weird anyways

if you know how the fuck to make this /commandtechno/discasset please tell me but i need to sleep because it is a school night and i need to do school stuff tomorrow so i need to sleep please i need sleep holy shit what the fuck is going on

this is my version of https://gitlab.com/derpystuff/discasset because it is slightly more scuffed than i would like

gets more shit and uses parsers instead of regex, sometimes slower, sometimes faster

does not currently get svgs
